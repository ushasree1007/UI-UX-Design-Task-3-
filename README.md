DESCRIPTION:  As part of Task 3 of the Codtech UI/UX Internship, I undertook the redesign of a mobile Weather App with the objective of improving its visual design, functionality, and overall user experience. Weather apps are widely used by people of all ages, yet many suffer from outdated designs, cluttered interfaces, or lack of intuitive navigation. My goal was to create a clean, modern, and informative interface that makes it easy for users to check current weather, upcoming forecasts, and air quality data at a glance.

Using Figma, I designed multiple screens including a home page with real-time temperature and location display, a temperature trend graph page, an air quality and humidity screen, and a weekly weather summary. I carefully selected simple and meaningful icons for navigation (such as home, forecast graph, alerts, and settings), and used a clean layout with soft colors and readable typography to enhance user comfort. The redesign also included graphical weather trends and visual alerts to make the information more accessible and interactive.

This project helped me strengthen my UI/UX design skills, especially in areas like visual hierarchy, layout consistency, icon usage, and user-centered thinking. Overall, the redesigned weather app offers a sleek and user-friendly experience that improves both aesthetics and functionality.
